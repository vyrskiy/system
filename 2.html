      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>While analyzing the description of <i>Homo naledi</i>, it was observed that the founders
failed to specify any maternal or other species phyletically associated with <i>H. naledi</i>.
Moreover, the direction of further evolution of the species was not determined, and it
was concluded that the species is extinct. Furthermore, exclusively morphometric
characteristics of the remains have been used for species diagnostics, which is typical
of the methods of the morphological species concept.

      <p>For a more precise definition of the position of <i>H. naledi</i> among other species of
the genus Homo within the African bipedal primate system, this study attempted to
identify the fossil characters that are diagnostically essential from the point of view of
the biological species concept. This study helped reveal the age of the fossil collection
deposit and concluded that <i>H. naledi</i> shares a common origin with other species of the
genus Homo. In addition, it was shown that <i>H. naledi</i> had a hand structure that was
progressive for its time and a high cerebral index, which raises doubts regarding the
validity of its extinction.
